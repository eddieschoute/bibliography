  abstract    = {Due to the difficulty of constructing new quantum algorithms, frameworks that facilitate this construction are of great importance in quantum computing. These frameworks reduce the problem of coming up with a quantum algorithm to that of constructing some combinatorial object that is often much simpler to reason about. The implementation and analysis of an algorithm for the specified problem follow from the properties of this object. A number of such frameworks have been extremely successful in leading to the development of numerous quantum algorithms for a variety of problems. In this thesis, we build on two of these frameworks, the quantum walk search framework, and the span program framework, extending their algorithmic potential. The quantum walk search framework gives a generic quantum analogue to a specific type of classical algorithm based on random walks. If one can construct a classical algorithm of this form, a corresponding quantum algorithm with better complexity immediately follows. In this framework, a generic algorithm is constructed from several subroutines for which implementations must be given for each application. One of these subroutines, a checking subroutine, is run many times throughout the algorithm. This subroutine may be implemented by any quantum algorithm that satisfies the required functionality, including another quantum walk algorithm. By making a slight modification to the quantum walk framework, we can show how to nest a quantum walk algorithm in the checking subroutine of another quantum walk algorithm in a way that gives better complexity than the naive nesting. This modification allows us to reproduce a number of upper bounds previously obtained in another framework, the learning graph framework, including upper bounds for triangle finding, and more generally, subgraph finding for constant-sized subgraphs. Porting these upper bounds over to the setting of quantum walks is desirable because the algorithms achieved in the quantum walk search framework are much more explicit than those of the learning graph framework, making them easier to work with, modify, and build on, as needed. Our efficient nested checking idea has already been used to come up with new quantum algorithms for finding sub-hypergraphs. Another subroutine that is called repeatedly by the generic quantum walk search algorithm is the update subroutine. It was not clear how to use a quantum walk algorithm to perform this step, but by making another slight modification to the quantum walk search framework, we are able to show how to nest a quantum walk in the update step of another quantum walk in an efficient way. Our technique for doing this is a special case of a technique that allows the update to be implemented with garbage --- i.e., some unwanted data in an auxiliary register, entangled with the desired state. This technique may have other applications. Using the nested update technique, we are able to improve the best known upper bounds on the time complexity of $k$-distinctness. Previously the best known upper bound on the time complexity was $n^{k/(k+1)}$, due to Ambainis. Belovs had recently improved the query complexity of $k$-distinctness to $o(n^{3/4})$ for all $k$, but since this upper bound was obtained in a framework called span programs, which only gives upper bounds on quantum query complexity, there was no known time efficient implementation of his $k$-distinctness algorithm. We use ideas from his construction and our nested update technique to get a quantum time upper bound for $3$-distinctness of $n^{5/7}$, matching his quantum query upper bound. We can generalize our algorithm get a time upper bound of $n^{(k-1)/k}$ for any $k>3$, slightly improving on the best previous upper bound. Another framework, the span program framework, is known to be equivalent to quantum query complexity, in the sense that for any Boolean decision problem, there exists a span program construction that yields a tight upper bound on its quantum query complexity. We explore several variations of this framework. First, we slightly modify the definition of a span program so that we can show that for \emph{any} (not necessarily Boolean) decision problem, there is a span program construction that yields a tight upper bound on its quantum query complexity. Previously this was only known up to logarithmic factors. We also explore several approximate versions of span programs, and show them to be equivalent. Finally, we explore the structure of span program witnesses, and use this structure to present an algorithm for evaluating span programs that is straightforward and intuitive. We also show how to evaluate approximate span programs, opening the possibility for the construction of new upper bounds using approximate span programs.},

  abstract      = {We provide a quantum algorithm for simulating the dynamics of sparse Hamiltonians with complexity sublogarithmic in the inverse error, an exponential improvement over previous methods. Specifically, we show that a d-sparse Hamiltonian H on n qubits can be simulated for time t with precision ε using O(τlog(τ/ε)/log log(τ/ε)) queries and O(τnlog2(τ/ε)/log log(τ/ε)) additional 2-qubit gates, where τ=d2||H||maxt. Unlike previous approaches based on product formulas, the query complexity is independent of the number of qubits acted on, and for time-varying Hamiltonians, the gate complexity is logarithmic in the norm of the derivative of the Hamiltonian. Our algorithm is based on a significantly improved simulation of the continuous- and fractional-query models using discrete quantum queries, showing that the former models are not much more powerful than the discrete model even for very small error. We also significantly simplify the analysis of this conversion, avoiding the need for a complex fault correction procedure. Our simplification relies on a new form of "oblivious amplitude amplification" that can be applied even though the reflection about the input state is unavailable. Finally, we prove new lower bounds showing that our algorithms are optimal as a function of the error.},

  abstract      = {Quantum information technologies, on the one side, and intelligent learning systems, on the other, are both emergent technologies that will likely have a transforming impact on our society in the future. The respective underlying fields of basic research – quantum information (QI) versus machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) – have their own specific questions and challenges, which have hitherto been investigated largely independently. However, in a growing body of recent work, researchers have been prob- ing the question to what extent these fields can indeed learn and benefit from each other. QML explores the interaction between quantum computing and machine learning, inves- tigating how results and techniques from one field can be used to solve the problems of the other. In recent time, we have witnessed significant breakthroughs in both directions of influence. For instance, quantum computing is finding a vital application in providing speed-ups for machine learning problems, critical in our “big data” world. Conversely, machine learning already permeates many cutting-edge technologies, and may become instrumental in advanced quantum technologies. Aside from quantum speed-up in data analysis, or classical machine learning optimization used in quantum experiments, quan- tum enhancements have also been (theoretically) demonstrated for interactive learning tasks, highlighting the potential of quantum-enhanced learning agents. Finally, works exploring the use of artificial intelligence for the very design of quantum experiments, and for performing parts of genuine research autonomously, have reported their first successes. Beyond the topics of mutual enhancement – exploring what ML/AI can do for quantum physics, and vice versa – researchers have also broached the fundamental issue of quantum generalizations of learning and AI concepts. This deals with questions of the very meaning of learning and intelligence in a world that is fully described by quantum mechanics. In this review, we describe the main ideas, recent developments, and progress in a broad spectrum of research investigating machine learning and artificial intelligence in the quantum domain.},

  year        = {2016},
  abstract    = {A quantum network promises to enable long distance quantum communication, and assemble small quantum devices into a large quantum computing cluster. Each network node can thereby be seen as a small few qubit quantum computer. Qubits can be sent over direct physical links connecting nearby quantum nodes, or by means of teleportation over pre-established entanglement amongst distant network nodes. Such pre-shared entanglement effectively forms a shortcut - a virtual quantum link - which can be used exactly once. 
Here, we present an abstraction of a quantum network that allows ideas from computer science to be applied to the problem of routing qubits, and manage entanglement in the network. Specifically, we consider a scenario in which each quantum network node can create EPR pairs with its immediate neighbours over a physical connection, and perform entanglement swapping operations in order to create long distance virtual quantum links. We proceed to discuss the features unique to quantum networks, which call for the development of new routing techniques. As an example, we present two simple hierarchical routing schemes for a quantum network of N nodes for a ring and sphere topology. For these topologies we present efficient routing algorithms requiring O(log N) qubits to be stored at each network node, O(polylog N) time and space to perform routing decisions, and O(log N) timesteps to replenish the virtual quantum links in a model of entanglement generation.},

  abstract    = {Communication is a key part of society that we make huge investments in. Each message has to both arrive quickly and use minimal network resources. Moreover, communications must sometimes also remain private, so encryption is used to prevent third parties from listening in. However, standard classical encryption protocols are proven not to be secure against quantum adversaries. With quantum communication we have a method that does provably attains perfect secrecy, even against adversaries with unlimited (quantum) computational power. It is, however, infeasible to have a direct quantum connection between all users of quantum communications. We thus look into the possibilities of a quantum network, which is able to connect arbitrary users of the network as if they had direct quantum channel available.
Once such a quantum network is built, we will need to route quantum messages e ectively to their destina- tion. In this work, we take the  rst step in studying network structures for quantum networks on a high level, and their accompanying routing algorithms. Current ongoing research into quantum communication with satellites and the possibility of a global network made the case of a quantum network of satellites relevant. We will consider a simpli ed model where each satellite can perform quantum communication with its immediate neighbours, and can create quantum virtual links that form shortcuts through the network.
The  rst step towards a quantum network that we take is the structure of the network. Using virtual links as shortcuts we can reduce the maximum distance between nodes (the diameter) by an exponential factor. Let |V | be the size of the set of all vertices in a graph, equal to the number of satellites. Then for the case of satellites we give a network structure with the following properties:
()
• The diameter of the graph is 4 log |V |−2 + 3 = O(log |V |). This means that the distance between any 2 10
two nodes in the graph will scale logarithmically in the number of nodes.
()
• The maximum degree of a vertex is 12 log |V |−2 + 6 = O(log |V |). The degree of a vertex is directly 2 10
related to the size of its quantum memory. Since quantum memories are currently limited in size, it is important for feasibility reasons that the degree stays low.
With a logarithmic scaling, the diameter and degree scale well for large graphs. This is especially relevant for networks, which can become large. A lower distance between vertices also allows quantum communications to fail less often, in e ect decreasing the communication time. We can thus achieve a much smaller diameter by using virtual links, while the degree of each vertex remains low.
We furthermore give a routing algorithm for  nding the shortest path on this network structure that only uses local information at each vertex to route, where local information is the nearby surroundings of a vertex. The routing algorithm has the following properties:
• The space complexity of the algorithm is O(log5 |V |) per vertex. A small space complexity implies little memory usage of the algorithm. Since network routers are typically small computers, the small memory requirement allows them to run this algorithm.
• The time complexity of the algorithm is O(log2 |V |) per vertex. A small time complexity allows network nodes to compute the next step in the path in minimal time. The time necessary to communicate decreases with decreasing time complexity.
For large enough |V |, our algorithm outperforms standard routing algorithms such as Dijkstra’s algorithm by an exponential factor. Furthermore, we have proved that the local routing algorithm always gives a shortest path. Local routing transitions well into a real world implementation, so that every network router can make simple decisions for routing.},

Consider also a quantum algorithm $\mathcal A$ such that $A |0\rangle= \sum_{x\in X} \alpha_x |x\rangle$ is a quantum superposition of the elements of $X$, and let $a$ denote the probability that a good element is produced if $A |0\rangle$ is measured. If we repeat the process of running $A$, measuring the output, and using $\chi$ to check the validity of the result, we shall expect to repeat $1/a$ times on the average before a solution is found. *Amplitude amplification* is a process that allows to find a good $x$ after an expected number of applications of $A$ and its inverse which is proportional to $1/\sqrt{a}$, assuming algorithm $A$ makes no measurements. This is a generalization of Grover's searching algorithm in which $A$ was restricted to producing an equal superposition of all members of $X$ and we had a promise that a single $x$ existed such that $\chi(x)=1$. Our algorithm works whether or not the value of $a$ is known ahead of time. In case the value of $a$ is known, we can find a good $x$ after a number of applications of $A$ and its inverse which is proportional to $1/\sqrt{a}$ even in the worst case. We show that this quadratic speedup can also be obtained for a large family of search problems for which good classical heuristics exist. Finally, as our main result, we combine ideas from Grover's and Shor's quantum algorithms to perform amplitude estimation, a process that allows to estimate the value of $a$. We apply amplitude estimation to the problem of *approximate counting*, in which we wish to estimate the number of $x\in X$ such that $\chi(x)=1$. We obtain optimal quantum algorithms in a variety of settings.},

We also show limits on this approach to quantum SDP-solvers, for instance for combinatorial optimizations problems that have a lot of symmetry. Finally, we prove some general lower bounds showing that in the worst case, the complexity of every quantum LP-solver (and hence also SDP-solver) has to scale linearly with mn when m ≈ n, which is the same as classical.},

  abstract      = {We present several new examples of speed-ups obtainable by quantum algorithms in the context of property testing. First, motivated by sampling algorithms, we consider probability distributions given in the form of an oracle $f:[n]\to[m]$. Here the probability $\PP_f(j)$ of an outcome $j\in[m]$ is the fraction of its domain that $f$ maps to $j$. We give quantum algorithms for testing whether two such distributions are identical or $\epsilon$-far in $L_1$-norm. Recently, Bravyi, Hassidim, and Harrow \cite{BHH10} showed that if $\PP_f$ and $\PP_g$ are both unknown (i.e., given by oracles $f$ and $g$), then this testing can be done in roughly $\sqrt{m}$ quantum queries to the functions. We consider the case where the second distribution is known, and show that testing can be done with roughly $m^{1/3}$ quantum queries, which we prove to be essentially optimal. In contrast, it is known that classical testing algorithms need about $m^{2/3}$ queries in the unknown-unknown case and about $\sqrt{m}$ queries in the known-unknown case. Based on this result, we also reduce the query complexity of graph isomorphism testers with quantum oracle access. While those examples provide polynomial quantum speed-ups, our third example gives a much larger improvement (constant quantum queries vs polynomial classical queries) for the problem of testing periodicity, based on Shor's algorithm and a modification of a classical lower bound by Lachish and Newman \cite{lachish&newman:periodicity}. This provides an alternative to a recent constant-vs-polynomial speed-up due to Aaronson \cite{aaronson:bqpph}.},

Previous algorithms had optimal or near-optimal scaling in some parameters at the cost of poor scaling in others. Hamiltonian simulation via a quantum walk has optimal dependence on the sparsity at the expense of poor scaling in the allowed error. In contrast, an approach based on fractional-query simulation provides optimal scaling in the error at the expense of poor scaling in the sparsity. Here we combine the two approaches, achieving the best features of both. By implementing a linear combination of quantum walk steps with coefficients given by Bessel functions, our algorithm's complexity (as measured by the number of queries and 2-qubit gates) is logarithmic in the inverse error, and nearly linear in the product tau of the evolution time, the sparsity, and the magnitude of the largest entry of the Hamiltonian. Our dependence on the error is optimal, and we prove a new lower bound showing that no algorithm can have sub linear dependence on tau.},

  abstract  = {We study problems in distribution property testing: Given sample access to one or more unknown discrete distributions, we want to determine whether they have some global property or are epsilon-far from having the property in L1 distance (equivalently, total variation distance, or "statistical distance").In this work, we give a novel general approach for distribution testing. We describe two techniques: our first technique gives sample-optimal testers, while our second technique gives matching sample lower bounds. As a consequence, we resolve the sample complexity of a wide variety of testing problems. Our upper bounds are obtained via a modular reduction-based approach. Our approach yields optimal testers for numerous problemsby using a standard L2-identity tester as a black-box. Using this recipe, we obtain simple estimators for a wide range of problems, encompassing many problems previously studied in the TCS literature, namely: (1) identity testing to a fixed distribution, (2) closeness testing between two unknown distributions (with equal/unequal sample sizes), (3) independence testing (in any number of dimensions), (4) closeness testing for collections of distributions, and(5) testing histograms. For all of these problems, our testers are sample-optimal, up to constant factors. With the exception of (1), ours are the first sample-optimal testers for the corresponding problems. Moreover, our estimators are significantly simpler to state and analyze compared to previous results. As an important application of our reduction-based technique, we obtain the first adaptive algorithm for testing equivalence betweentwo unknown distributions. The sample complexity of our algorithm depends on the structure of the unknown distributions - as opposed to merely their domain size -and is significantly better compared to the worst-case optimal L1-tester in many natural instances. Moreover, our technique naturally generalizes to other metrics beyond the L1-distance. As an illu- tration of its flexibility, we use it to obtain the first near-optimal equivalence testerunder the Hellinger distance. Our lower bounds are obtained via a direct information-theoretic approach: Given a candidate hard instance, our proof proceeds by boundingthe mutual information between appropriate random variables. While this is a classical method in information theory, prior to our work, it had not been used in this context. Previous lower bounds relied either on the birthday paradox, oron moment-matching and were thus restricted to symmetric properties. Our lower bound approach does not suffer from any such restrictions and gives tight sample lower bounds for the aforementioned problems.},

Our method has complexity linear in both the sparseness D (the maximum number of nonzero elements in a column) and the evolution time t, whereas previous methods had complexity scaling as D4 and were superlinear in t. We also consider the task of implementing an arbitrary unitary operation given a black-box description of its matrix elements. Whereas standard methods for performing an explicitly specified N × N unitary operation use Õ(N2) elementary gates, we show that a black-box unitary can be performed with bounded error using O(N2/3(log logN)4/3) queries to its matrix elements. In fact, except for pathological cases, it appears that most unitaries can be performed with only Õ(√N) queries, which is optimal.},

In this paper we improve their algorithms in sev- eral ways, getting better dependence on those other parameters. To this end we develop new techniques for quantum algorithms, for instance a general way to efficiently implement smooth functions of sparse Hamiltonians, and a generalized minimum-finding procedure.
We also show limits on this approach to quantum SDP-solvers, for instance for combinatorial optimizations problems that have a lot of symmetry. Finally, we prove some general lower bounds showing that in the worst case, the complexity of every quantum LP-solver (and hence also SDP-solver) has to scale linearly with mn when m ≈ n, which is the same as classical.},

In this paper, we suggest extensions of the existing synthesis flow aimed to realize circuits for quantum architectures with linear nearest neighbor interaction. To this end, a template matching optimization, an exact synthesis approach, and two reordering strategies are introduced. The proposed methods are combined as an integrated synthesis flow. Experiments show that by using the suggested flow, quantum cost can be improved by more than 50{\%} on average.},

We investigate the impact of these annotations for the example of Shor's algorithm in terms of logical gate counts. Furthermore, we analyze the effect of different intermediate gate sets for optimization and how the dimensions of the resulting circuit depend on a smart choice thereof. Finally, we demonstrate the benefits of a modular compilation framework by implementing mapping procedures for one- and two-dimensional nearest neighbor architectures which we then compare in terms of overhead for different problem sizes.},

Many known results on sorting networks can be stated in terms of sorting numbers of different classes of graphs. In this paper we show the following general results about the sorting number of graphs. Any $n$-vertex graph that contains a simple path of length $d$ has a sorting network of depth $O(n \log(n/d))$. Any $n$-vertex graph with maximal degree $\Delta$ has a sorting network of depth $O(\Delta n)$. We also provide several results that relate the sorting number of a graph with its routing number, size of its maximal matching, and other well known graph properties. Additionally, we give some new bounds on the sorting number for some typical graphs.},

Each token has exactly one destination vertex, and we try to move all the tokens to their destinations, using the minimum number of swaps, i.e., operations of exchanging the tokens on two adjacent vertices. As the main result of this paper, we show that Token Swapping is $W[1]$-hard parameterized by the length $k$ of a shortest sequence of swaps. In fact, we prove that, for any computable function $f$, it cannot be solved in time $f(k)n^{o(k / \log k)}$ where $n$ is the number of vertices of the input graph, unless the ETH fails. This lower bound almost matches the trivial $n^{O(k)}$-time algorithm. We also consider two generalizations of the Token Swapping, namely Colored Token Swapping (where the tokens have different colors and tokens of the same color are indistinguishable), and Subset Token Swapping (where each token has a set of possible destinations). To complement the hardness result, we prove that even the most general variant, Subset Token Swapping, is FPT in nowhere-dense graph classes. Finally, we consider the complexities of all three problems in very restricted classes of graphs: graphs of bounded treewidth and diameter, stars, cliques, and paths, trying to identify the borderlines between polynomial and NP-hard cases.},

We consider the algorithmic question of finding a shortest sequence of swaps such that token $T_i$ is on vertex $i$. We are able to achieve essentially matching upper and lower bounds, for exact algorithms and approximation algorithms. For exact algorithms, we rule out any $2^{o(n)}$ algorithm under the ETH. This is matched with a simple $2^{O(n\log n)}$ algorithm based on a breadth-first search in an auxiliary graph. We show one general $4$-approximation and show APX-hardness. Thus, there is a small constant $\delta>1$ such that every polynomial time approximation algorithm has approximation factor at least $\delta$. Our results also hold for a generalized version, where tokens and vertices are colored. In this generalized version each token must go to a vertex with the same color.},

We consider quantum simulation of spin systems, which could be applied to understand condensed matter phenomena. We synthesize explicit circuits for three leading quantum simulation algorithms, employing diverse techniques to tighten error bounds and optimize circuit implementations. Quantum signal processing appears to be preferred among algorithms with rigorous performance guarantees, whereas higher-order product formulas prevail if empirical error estimates suffice.

  abstract    = {Given a Hermitian operator $\hat{H}=\langle G|\hat{U}|G\rangle$ that is the projection of an oracle $\hat{U}$ by state $|G\rangle$ created with oracle $\hat{G}$, the problem of Hamiltonian simulation is approximating the time evolution operator $e^{-i\hat{H}t}$ at time $t$ with error $\epsilon$. We show that this can be done with query complexity $\mathcal{O}\big(t+\frac{\log{(1/\epsilon)}}{\log\log{(1/\epsilon)}}\big)$ to $\hat{G},\hat{U}$ that is optimal, not just in asymptotic limits, but for all values $t,\epsilon$. Furthermore, only $2$ additional ancilla qubits are required in total, together with $\mathcal{O}(1)$ additional single and two-qubit gates per query. Our approach to Hamiltonian simulation subsumes important prior art considering Hamiltonians which are $d$-sparse or a linear combination of unitaries, leading to significant improvements in space complexity, as well as a quadratic speed-up for precision simulations. It also motivates useful new instances, such as where $\langle G|\hat{U}|G\rangle$ is a density matrix. A key technical result is `qubitization' which uses controlled-$\hat{U}$ and controlled-$\hat{G}$ to embed $\hat{H}$ in an invariant $\text{SU}(2)$ subspace. A large class of operator functions of $\hat{H}$ can then be computed with optimal query complexity, of which $e^{-i\hat{H}t}$ is a special case.},

  abstract    = {The Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) technology is currently investigated by major players in the field to build the first practically useful quantum computer. IBM QX architectures are the first ones which are already publicly available today. However, in order to use them, the respective quantum circuits have to be compiled for the respectively used target architecture. While first approaches have been proposed for this purpose, they are infeasible for a certain set of SU(4) quantum circuits which recently have been introduced to benchmark such compilers. In this work, we analyze the bottlenecks of existing compilers and provide a dedicated method for compiling these kind of circuits to IBM QX architectures. Our experimental evaluation (using tools provided by IBM) shows that the proposed approach significantly outperforms IBM's own solution regarding fidelity of the compiled circuit as well as runtime. An implementation of the proposed methodology is publicly available at http://iic.jku.at/eda/research/ibm_qx_mapping.},

  abstract    = {In the past years, quantum computers more and more have evolved from an academic idea to an upcoming reality. IBM's project IBM Q can be seen as evidence of this progress. Launched in March 2017 with the goal to provide access to quantum computers for a broad audience, this allowed users to conduct quantum experiments on a 5-qubit and, since June 2017, also on a 16-qubit quantum computer (called IBM QX2 and IBM QX3, respectively). Revised versions of these 5-qubit and 16-qubit quantum computers (named IBM QX4 and IBM QX5, respectively) are available since September 2017. In order to use these, the desired quantum functionality (e.g. provided in terms of a quantum circuit) has to be properly mapped so that the underlying physical constraints are satisfied - a complex task. This demands solutions to automatically and efficiently conduct this mapping process. In this paper, we propose a methodology which addresses this problem, i.e. maps the given quantum functionality to a realization which satisfies all constraints given by the architecture and, at the same time, keeps the overhead in terms of additionally required quantum gates minimal. The proposed methodology is generic, can easily be configured for similar future architectures, and is fully integrated into IBM's SDK. Experimental evaluations show that the proposed approach clearly outperforms IBM's own mapping solution. In fact, for many quantum circuits, the proposed approach determines a mapping to the IBM architecture within minutes, while IBM's solution suffers from long runtimes and runs into a timeout of 1 hour in several cases. As an additional benefit, the proposed approach yields mapped circuits with smaller costs (i.e. fewer additional gates are required). All implementations of the proposed methodology is publicly available at http://iic.jku.at/eda/research/ibm_qx_mapping.},

  abstract    = {Due to little consideration in the hardware constraints, e.g., limited connections between physical qubits to enable two-qubit gates, most quantum algorithms cannot be directly executed on the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. Dynamically remapping logical qubits to physical qubits in the compiler is needed to enable the two-qubit gates in the algorithm, which introduces additional operations and inevitably reduces the fidelity of the algorithm. Previous solutions in finding such remapping suffer from high complexity, poor initial mapping quality, and limited flexibility and controllability. To address these drawbacks mentioned above, this paper proposes a SWAP-based BidiREctional heuristic search algorithm SABRE, which is applicable to NISQ devices with arbitrary connections between qubits. By optimizing every search attempt,globally optimizing the initial mapping using a novel reverse traversal technique, introducing the decay effect to enable the trade-off between the depth and the number of gates of the entire algorithm, SABRE outperforms the best known algorithm with exponential speedup and comparable or better results on various benchmarks.},

In this work, we examine the impact of different graph structures on the preparation of entangled states. We begin by explaining a formal framework, the hierarchical product, in which modular graphs can be easily constructed. This framework naturally leads us to suggest a class of graphs, which we dub hierarchies. We argue that such graphs have favorable properties for quantum information processing, such as a small diameter and small total edge weight, and use the concept of Pareto efficiency to identify promising quantum graph architectures. We present numerical and analytical results on the speed at which large entangled states can be created on nearest-neighbor grids and hierarchy graphs. We also present a scheme for performing circuit placement--the translation from circuit diagrams to machine qubits--on quantum systems whose connectivity is described by hierarchies.},

This is a parallel routing model which was introduced by Alon et al\cite{alon1994routing}. The model can be viewed as a communication scheme on a distributed network. The nodes in the network can communicate via matchings (a step), where a node exchanges data (pebbles) with its matched partner. Let $G$ be a connected graph with vertices labeled from $\{1,...,n\}$ and the destination vertices of the pebbles are given by a permutation $\pi$. The problem is to find a minimum step routing scheme for the input permutation $\pi$. This is denoted as the routing time $rt(G,\pi)$ of $G$ given $\pi$. In this paper we characterize the complexity of some known problems under the routing via matching model and discuss their relationship to graph connectivity and clique number. We also introduce some new problems in this domain, which may be of independent interest.},

  abstract    = {This paper addresses the problem of finding the depth overhead that will be incurred when running quantum algorithms on near-term quantum computers. Specifically, it is envisaged that near-term quantum computers will have low qubit connectivity: each qubit will only be able to interact with a subset of the other qubits, a reality typically represented by a qubit interaction graph in which a vertex represents a qubit and an edge represents a possible direct 2-qubit interaction (gate). Thus the depth overhead is unavoidably incurred by introducing swap gates into the quantum circuit to enable general qubit interactions. This paper proves that there exist quantum circuits where a depth overhead in $\Omega(\log n)$ must necessarily be incurred when running quantum algorithms with $n$ qubits on quantum computers whose qubit interaction graph has finite degree, but that such a depth overhead is achievable.},

Several different quantum circuits implementing Shor's algorithm have been designed, but each tacitly assumes that arbitrary pairs of qubits within the computer can be interacted. While some quantum computer architectures possess this property, many promising proposals are best suited to realising a single line of qubits with nearest neighbour interactions only. In light of this, we present a circuit implementing Shor's factorisation algorithm designed for such a linear nearest neighbour architecture. Despite the interaction restrictions, the circuit requires just $2L+4$ qubits and to first order requires $8L^{4}$ gates arranged in a circuit of depth $32L^{3}$ -- identical to first order to that possible using an architecture that can interact arbitrary pairs of qubits.},

  abstract    = {A massive gap exists between current quantum computing (QC) prototypes, and the size and scale required for many proposed QC algorithms. Current QC implementations are prone to noise and variability which affect their reliability, and yet with less than 80 quantum bits (qubits) total, they are too resource-constrained to implement error correction. The term Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) refers to these current and near-term systems of 1000 qubits or less. Given NISQ's severe resource constraints, low reliability, and high variability in physical characteristics such as coherence time or error rates, it is of pressing importance to map computations onto them in ways that use resources efficiently and maximize the likelihood of successful runs. This paper proposes and evaluates backend compiler approaches to map and optimize high-level QC programs to execute with high reliability on NISQ systems with diverse hardware characteristics. Our techniques all start from an LLVM intermediate representation of the quantum program (such as would be generated from high-level QC languages like Scaffold) and generate QC executables runnable on the IBM Q public QC machine. We then use this framework to implement and evaluate several optimal and heuristic mapping methods. These methods vary in how they account for the availability of dynamic machine calibration data, the relative importance of various noise parameters, the different possible routing strategies, and the relative importance of compile-time scalability versus runtime success. Using real-system measurements, we show that fine grained spatial and temporal variations in hardware parameters can be exploited to obtain an average $2.9$x (and up to $18$x) improvement in program success rate over the industry standard IBM Qiskit compiler.},

  abstract    = {We show that the depth of quantum circuits in the realistic architecture where a classical controller determines which local interactions to apply on the kD grid Z^k where k >= 2 is the same (up to a constant factor) as in the standard model where arbitrary interactions are allowed. This allows minimum-depth circuits (up to a constant factor) for the nearest-neighbor architecture to be obtained from minimum-depth circuits in the standard abstract model. Our work therefore justifies the standard assumption that interactions can be performed between arbitrary pairs of qubits. In particular, our results imply that Shor's algorithm, controlled operations and fanouts can be implemented in constant depth, polynomial size and polynomial width in this architecture. We also present optimal non-adaptive quantum circuits for controlled operations and fanouts on a kD grid. These circuits have depth Theta(n^(1 / k)), size Theta(n) and width Theta(n). Our lower bound also applies to a more general class of operations.},
