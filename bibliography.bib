  abstract    = {A massive gap exists between current quantum computing (QC) prototypes, and the size and scale required for many proposed QC algorithms. Current QC implementations are prone to noise and variability which affect their reliability, and yet with less than 80 quantum bits (qubits) total, they are too resource-constrained to implement error correction. The term Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) refers to these current and near-term systems of 1000 qubits or less. Given NISQ's severe resource constraints, low reliability, and high variability in physical characteristics such as coherence time or error rates, it is of pressing importance to map computations onto them in ways that use resources efficiently and maximize the likelihood of successful runs. This paper proposes and evaluates backend compiler approaches to map and optimize high-level QC programs to execute with high reliability on NISQ systems with diverse hardware characteristics. Our techniques all start from an LLVM intermediate representation of the quantum program (such as would be generated from high-level QC languages like Scaffold) and generate QC executables runnable on the IBM Q public QC machine. We then use this framework to implement and evaluate several optimal and heuristic mapping methods. These methods vary in how they account for the availability of dynamic machine calibration data, the relative importance of various noise parameters, the different possible routing strategies, and the relative importance of compile-time scalability versus runtime success. Using real-system measurements, we show that fine grained spatial and temporal variations in hardware parameters can be exploited to obtain an average $2.9$x (and up to $18$x) improvement in program success rate over the industry standard IBM Qiskit compiler.},

  abstract    = {Trapped ions (TI) are a leading candidate for building Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware. TI qubits have fundamental advantages over other technologies such as superconducting qubits, including high qubit quality, coherence and connectivity. However, current TI systems are small in size, with 5-20 qubits and typically use a single trap architecture which has fundamental scalability limitations. To progress towards the next major milestone of 50-100 qubits, a modular architecture termed the Quantum Charge Coupled Device (QCCD) has been proposed. In a QCCD-based TI device, small traps are connected through ion shuttling. While the basic hardware components for such devices have been demonstrated, building a 50-100 qubit system is challenging because of a wide range of design possibilities for trap sizing, communication topology and gate implementations and the need to match diverse application resource requirements. Towards realizing QCCD systems with 50-100 qubits, we perform an extensive architectural study evaluating the key design choices of trap sizing, communication topology and operation implementation methods. We built a design toolflow which takes a QCCD architecture's parameters as input, along with a set of applications and realistic hardware performance models. Our toolflow maps the applications onto the target device and simulates their execution to compute metrics such as application run time, reliability and device noise rates. Using six applications and several hardware design points, we show that trap sizing and communication topology choices can impact application reliability by up to three orders of magnitude. Microarchitectural gate implementation choices influence reliability by another order of magnitude. From these studies, we provide concrete recommendations to tune these choices to achieve highly reliable and performant application executions.},

While first approaches have been proposed for this purpose, they are infeasible for a certain set of SU(4) quantum circuits which recently have been introduced to benchmark such compilers. In this work, we analyze the bottlenecks of existing compilers and provide a dedicated method for compiling these kind of circuits to IBM QX architectures.

  abstract    = {Due to the difficulty of constructing new quantum algorithms, frameworks that facilitate this construction are of great importance in quantum computing. These frameworks reduce the problem of coming up with a quantum algorithm to that of constructing some combinatorial object that is often much simpler to reason about. The implementation and analysis of an algorithm for the specified problem follow from the properties of this object. A number of such frameworks have been extremely successful in leading to the development of numerous quantum algorithms for a variety of problems. In this thesis, we build on two of these frameworks, the quantum walk search framework, and the span program framework, extending their algorithmic potential. The quantum walk search framework gives a generic quantum analogue to a specific type of classical algorithm based on random walks. If one can construct a classical algorithm of this form, a corresponding quantum algorithm with better complexity immediately follows. In this framework, a generic algorithm is constructed from several subroutines for which implementations must be given for each application. One of these subroutines, a checking subroutine, is run many times throughout the algorithm. This subroutine may be implemented by any quantum algorithm that satisfies the required functionality, including another quantum walk algorithm. By making a slight modification to the quantum walk framework, we can show how to nest a quantum walk algorithm in the checking subroutine of another quantum walk algorithm in a way that gives better complexity than the naive nesting. This modification allows us to reproduce a number of upper bounds previously obtained in another framework, the learning graph framework, including upper bounds for triangle finding, and more generally, subgraph finding for constant-sized subgraphs. Porting these upper bounds over to the setting of quantum walks is desirable because the algorithms achieved in the quantum walk search framework are much more explicit than those of the learning graph framework, making them easier to work with, modify, and build on, as needed. Our efficient nested checking idea has already been used to come up with new quantum algorithms for finding sub-hypergraphs. Another subroutine that is called repeatedly by the generic quantum walk search algorithm is the update subroutine. It was not clear how to use a quantum walk algorithm to perform this step, but by making another slight modification to the quantum walk search framework, we are able to show how to nest a quantum walk in the update step of another quantum walk in an efficient way. Our technique for doing this is a special case of a technique that allows the update to be implemented with garbage --- i.e., some unwanted data in an auxiliary register, entangled with the desired state. This technique may have other applications. Using the nested update technique, we are able to improve the best known upper bounds on the time complexity of $k$-distinctness. Previously the best known upper bound on the time complexity was $n^{k/(k+1)}$, due to Ambainis. Belovs had recently improved the query complexity of $k$-distinctness to $o(n^{3/4})$ for all $k$, but since this upper bound was obtained in a framework called span programs, which only gives upper bounds on quantum query complexity, there was no known time efficient implementation of his $k$-distinctness algorithm. We use ideas from his construction and our nested update technique to get a quantum time upper bound for $3$-distinctness of $n^{5/7}$, matching his quantum query upper bound. We can generalize our algorithm get a time upper bound of $n^{(k-1)/k}$ for any $k>3$, slightly improving on the best previous upper bound. Another framework, the span program framework, is known to be equivalent to quantum query complexity, in the sense that for any Boolean decision problem, there exists a span program construction that yields a tight upper bound on its quantum query complexity. We explore several variations of this framework. First, we slightly modify the definition of a span program so that we can show that for \emph{any} (not necessarily Boolean) decision problem, there is a span program construction that yields a tight upper bound on its quantum query complexity. Previously this was only known up to logarithmic factors. We also explore several approximate versions of span programs, and show them to be equivalent. Finally, we explore the structure of span program witnesses, and use this structure to present an algorithm for evaluating span programs that is straightforward and intuitive. We also show how to evaluate approximate span programs, opening the possibility for the construction of new upper bounds using approximate span programs.},

Specifically, we show that a d-sparse Hamiltonian H on n qubits can be simulated for time t with precision ε using O(τlog(τ/ε)/log log(τ/ε)) queries and O(τnlog2(τ/ε)/log log(τ/ε)) additional 2-qubit gates, where τ=d2||H||maxt. Unlike previous approaches based on product formulas, the query complexity is independent of the number of qubits acted on, and for time-varying Hamiltonians, the gate complexity is logarithmic in the norm of the derivative of the Hamiltonian. Our algorithm is based on a significantly improved simulation of the continuous- and fractional-query models using discrete quantum queries, showing that the former models are not much more powerful than the discrete model even for very small error. We also significantly simplify the analysis of this conversion, avoiding the need for a complex fault correction procedure. Our simplification relies on a new form of "oblivious amplitude amplification" that can be applied even though the reflection about the input state is unavailable. Finally, we prove new lower bounds showing that our algorithms are optimal as a function of the error.},

  abstract      = {Quantum information technologies, on the one side, and intelligent learning systems, on the other, are both emergent technologies that will likely have a transforming impact on our society in the future. The respective underlying fields of basic research – quantum information (QI) versus machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) – have their own specific questions and challenges, which have hitherto been investigated largely independently. However, in a growing body of recent work, researchers have been prob- ing the question to what extent these fields can indeed learn and benefit from each other. QML explores the interaction between quantum computing and machine learning, inves- tigating how results and techniques from one field can be used to solve the problems of the other. In recent time, we have witnessed significant breakthroughs in both directions of influence. For instance, quantum computing is finding a vital application in providing speed-ups for machine learning problems, critical in our “big data” world. Conversely, machine learning already permeates many cutting-edge technologies, and may become instrumental in advanced quantum technologies. Aside from quantum speed-up in data analysis, or classical machine learning optimization used in quantum experiments, quan- tum enhancements have also been (theoretically) demonstrated for interactive learning tasks, highlighting the potential of quantum-enhanced learning agents. Finally, works exploring the use of artificial intelligence for the very design of quantum experiments, and for performing parts of genuine research autonomously, have reported their first successes. Beyond the topics of mutual enhancement – exploring what ML/AI can do for quantum physics, and vice versa – researchers have also broached the fundamental issue of quantum generalizations of learning and AI concepts. This deals with questions of the very meaning of learning and intelligence in a world that is fully described by quantum mechanics. In this review, we describe the main ideas, recent developments, and progress in a broad spectrum of research investigating machine learning and artificial intelligence in the quantum domain.},

  year        = {2016},
  abstract    = {A quantum network promises to enable long distance quantum communication, and assemble small quantum devices into a large quantum computing cluster. Each network node can thereby be seen as a small few qubit quantum computer. Qubits can be sent over direct physical links connecting nearby quantum nodes, or by means of teleportation over pre-established entanglement amongst distant network nodes. Such pre-shared entanglement effectively forms a shortcut - a virtual quantum link - which can be used exactly once. 
Here, we present an abstraction of a quantum network that allows ideas from computer science to be applied to the problem of routing qubits, and manage entanglement in the network. Specifically, we consider a scenario in which each quantum network node can create EPR pairs with its immediate neighbours over a physical connection, and perform entanglement swapping operations in order to create long distance virtual quantum links. We proceed to discuss the features unique to quantum networks, which call for the development of new routing techniques. As an example, we present two simple hierarchical routing schemes for a quantum network of N nodes for a ring and sphere topology. For these topologies we present efficient routing algorithms requiring O(log N) qubits to be stored at each network node, O(polylog N) time and space to perform routing decisions, and O(log N) timesteps to replenish the virtual quantum links in a model of entanglement generation.},

  abstract    = {Communication is a key part of society that we make huge investments in. Each message has to both arrive quickly and use minimal network resources. Moreover, communications must sometimes also remain private, so encryption is used to prevent third parties from listening in. However, standard classical encryption protocols are proven not to be secure against quantum adversaries. With quantum communication we have a method that does provably attains perfect secrecy, even against adversaries with unlimited (quantum) computational power. It is, however, infeasible to have a direct quantum connection between all users of quantum communications. We thus look into the possibilities of a quantum network, which is able to connect arbitrary users of the network as if they had direct quantum channel available.
Once such a quantum network is built, we will need to route quantum messages e ectively to their destina- tion. In this work, we take the  rst step in studying network structures for quantum networks on a high level, and their accompanying routing algorithms. Current ongoing research into quantum communication with satellites and the possibility of a global network made the case of a quantum network of satellites relevant. We will consider a simpli ed model where each satellite can perform quantum communication with its immediate neighbours, and can create quantum virtual links that form shortcuts through the network.
The  rst step towards a quantum network that we take is the structure of the network. Using virtual links as shortcuts we can reduce the maximum distance between nodes (the diameter) by an exponential factor. Let |V | be the size of the set of all vertices in a graph, equal to the number of satellites. Then for the case of satellites we give a network structure with the following properties:
()
• The diameter of the graph is 4 log |V |−2 + 3 = O(log |V |). This means that the distance between any 2 10
two nodes in the graph will scale logarithmically in the number of nodes.
()
• The maximum degree of a vertex is 12 log |V |−2 + 6 = O(log |V |). The degree of a vertex is directly 2 10
related to the size of its quantum memory. Since quantum memories are currently limited in size, it is important for feasibility reasons that the degree stays low.
With a logarithmic scaling, the diameter and degree scale well for large graphs. This is especially relevant for networks, which can become large. A lower distance between vertices also allows quantum communications to fail less often, in e ect decreasing the communication time. We can thus achieve a much smaller diameter by using virtual links, while the degree of each vertex remains low.
We furthermore give a routing algorithm for  nding the shortest path on this network structure that only uses local information at each vertex to route, where local information is the nearby surroundings of a vertex. The routing algorithm has the following properties:
• The space complexity of the algorithm is O(log5 |V |) per vertex. A small space complexity implies little memory usage of the algorithm. Since network routers are typically small computers, the small memory requirement allows them to run this algorithm.
• The time complexity of the algorithm is O(log2 |V |) per vertex. A small time complexity allows network nodes to compute the next step in the path in minimal time. The time necessary to communicate decreases with decreasing time complexity.
For large enough |V |, our algorithm outperforms standard routing algorithms such as Dijkstra’s algorithm by an exponential factor. Furthermore, we have proved that the local routing algorithm always gives a shortest path. Local routing transitions well into a real world implementation, so that every network router can make simple decisions for routing.},

Consider also a quantum algorithm $\mathcal A$ such that $A |0\rangle= \sum_{x\in X} \alpha_x |x\rangle$ is a quantum superposition of the elements of $X$, and let $a$ denote the probability that a good element is produced if $A |0\rangle$ is measured. If we repeat the process of running $A$, measuring the output, and using $\chi$ to check the validity of the result, we shall expect to repeat $1/a$ times on the average before a solution is found. *Amplitude amplification* is a process that allows to find a good $x$ after an expected number of applications of $A$ and its inverse which is proportional to $1/\sqrt{a}$, assuming algorithm $A$ makes no measurements. This is a generalization of Grover's searching algorithm in which $A$ was restricted to producing an equal superposition of all members of $X$ and we had a promise that a single $x$ existed such that $\chi(x)=1$. Our algorithm works whether or not the value of $a$ is known ahead of time. In case the value of $a$ is known, we can find a good $x$ after a number of applications of $A$ and its inverse which is proportional to $1/\sqrt{a}$ even in the worst case. We show that this quadratic speedup can also be obtained for a large family of search problems for which good classical heuristics exist. Finally, as our main result, we combine ideas from Grover's and Shor's quantum algorithms to perform amplitude estimation, a process that allows to estimate the value of $a$. We apply amplitude estimation to the problem of *approximate counting*, in which we wish to estimate the number of $x\in X$ such that $\chi(x)=1$. We obtain optimal quantum algorithms in a variety of settings.},

In this survey we describe recent results obtained for quantum property testing. This area natu- rally falls into three parts. First, we may consider quantum testers for properties of classical objects. We survey the main examples known where quantum testers can be much (sometimes exponentially) more efficient than classical testers. Second, we may consider classical testers of quantum objects. These arise for instance when one is trying to determine if quantum states or operations do what they are supposed to do, based only on classical input-output behavior. Finally, we may also consider quantum testers for properties of quantum objects, such as states or operations. We survey known bounds on testing various natural properties, such as whether two states are equal, whether a state is separable, whether two operations commute, etc. We also highlight connections to other areas of quantum information theory and mention a number of open questions.},

For example, any read-once quantum formula over Toffoli and single-qubit gates is equivalent to a read-once classical formula over Toffoli and NOT gates. We then show that the equivalence does not hold if the read-once restriction is removed.

  abstract    = {We present several new examples of speed-ups obtainable by quantum algorithms in the context of property testing. First, motivated by sampling algorithms, we consider probability distributions given in the form of an oracle $f:[n]\to[m]$. Here the probability $\PP_f(j)$ of an outcome $j\in[m]$ is the fraction of its domain that $f$ maps to $j$. We give quantum algorithms for testing whether two such distributions are identical or $\epsilon$-far in $L_1$-norm. Recently, Bravyi, Hassidim, and Harrow \cite{BHH10} showed that if $\PP_f$ and $\PP_g$ are both unknown (i.e., given by oracles $f$ and $g$), then this testing can be done in roughly $\sqrt{m}$ quantum queries to the functions. We consider the case where the second distribution is known, and show that testing can be done with roughly $m^{1/3}$ quantum queries, which we prove to be essentially optimal. In contrast, it is known that classical testing algorithms need about $m^{2/3}$ queries in the unknown-unknown case and about $\sqrt{m}$ queries in the known-unknown case. Based on this result, we also reduce the query complexity of graph isomorphism testers with quantum oracle access. While those examples provide polynomial quantum speed-ups, our third example gives a much larger improvement (constant quantum queries vs polynomial classical queries) for the problem of testing periodicity, based on Shor's algorithm and a modification of a classical lower bound by Lachish and Newman \cite{lachish\&newman:periodicity}. This provides an alternative to a recent constant-vs-polynomial speed-up due to Aaronson \cite{aaronson:bqpph}.},

Hamiltonian simulation via a quantum walk has optimal dependence on the sparsity at the expense of poor scaling in the allowed error. In contrast, an approach based on fractional-query simulation provides optimal scaling in the error at the expense of poor scaling in the sparsity. Here we combine the two approaches, achieving the best features of both. By implementing a linear combination of quantum walk steps with coefficients given by Bessel functions, our algorithm's complexity (as measured by the number of queries and 2-qubit gates) is logarithmic in the inverse error, and nearly linear in the product tau of the evolution time, the sparsity, and the magnitude of the largest entry of the Hamiltonian. Our dependence on the error is optimal, and we prove a new lower bound showing that no algorithm can have sub linear dependence on tau.},

We describe two techniques: our first technique gives sample-optimal testers, while our second technique gives matching sample lower bounds. As a consequence, we resolve the sample complexity of a wide variety of testing problems. Our upper bounds are obtained via a modular reduction-based approach. Our approach yields optimal testers for numerous problemsby using a standard L2-identity tester as a black-box. Using this recipe, we obtain simple estimators for a wide range of problems, encompassing many problems previously studied in the TCS literature, namely: (1) identity testing to a fixed distribution, (2) closeness testing between two unknown distributions (with equal/unequal sample sizes), (3) independence testing (in any number of dimensions), (4) closeness testing for collections of distributions, and(5) testing histograms. For all of these problems, our testers are sample-optimal, up to constant factors. With the exception of (1), ours are the first sample-optimal testers for the corresponding problems. Moreover, our estimators are significantly simpler to state and analyze compared to previous results. As an important application of our reduction-based technique, we obtain the first adaptive algorithm for testing equivalence betweentwo unknown distributions. The sample complexity of our algorithm depends on the structure of the unknown distributions - as opposed to merely their domain size -and is significantly better compared to the worst-case optimal L1-tester in many natural instances. Moreover, our technique naturally generalizes to other metrics beyond the L1-distance. As an illu- tration of its flexibility, we use it to obtain the first near-optimal equivalence testerunder the Hellinger distance. Our lower bounds are obtained via a direct information-theoretic approach: Given a candidate hard instance, our proof proceeds by boundingthe mutual information between appropriate random variables. While this is a classical method in information theory, prior to our work, it had not been used in this context. Previous lower bounds relied either on the birthday paradox, oron moment-matching and were thus restricted to symmetric properties. Our lower bound approach does not suffer from any such restrictions and gives tight sample lower bounds for the aforementioned problems.},

We also consider the task of implementing an arbitrary unitary operation given a black-box description of its matrix elements.

To motivate automated layout for quantum circuits, we investigate grid-based layouts and show a performance variance of four times as we vary grid structure and initial qubit placement. We then propose two polynomial-time design heuristics: a greedy algorithm suitable for small, congestion-free quantum circuits and a dataflow-based analysis approach to placement and routing with implicit initial placement of qubits. Finally, we show that our dataflow-based heuristic generates better layouts than the state-of-the-art automated grid-based layout and scheduling mechanism in terms of latency and potential pipelinability, but at the cost of some area.},

Limited interaction distance between gate qubits is one of the most common limitations. In this paper, we suggest extensions of the existing synthesis flow aimed to realize circuits for quantum architectures with linear nearest neighbor interaction. To this end, a template matching optimization, an exact synthesis approach, and two reordering strategies are introduced. The proposed methods are combined as an integrated synthesis flow. Experiments show that by using the suggested flow, quantum cost can be improved by more than 50{\%} on average.},

We investigate the impact of these annotations for the example of Shor's algorithm in terms of logical gate counts. Furthermore, we analyze the effect of different intermediate gate sets for optimization and how the dimensions of the resulting circuit depend on a smart choice thereof.

Many known results on sorting networks can be stated in terms of sorting numbers of different classes of graphs. In this paper we show the following general results about the sorting number of graphs. Any $n$-vertex graph that contains a simple path of length $d$ has a sorting network of depth $O(n \log(n/d))$. Any $n$-vertex graph with maximal degree $\Delta$ has a sorting network of depth $O(\Delta n)$. We also provide several results that relate the sorting number of a graph with its routing number, size of its maximal matching, and other well known graph properties. Additionally, we give some new bounds on the sorting number for some typical graphs.},

Each token has exactly one destination vertex, and we try to move all the tokens to their destinations, using the minimum number of swaps, i.e., operations of exchanging the tokens on two adjacent vertices. As the main result of this paper, we show that Token Swapping is $W[1]$-hard parameterized by the length $k$ of a shortest sequence of swaps. In fact, we prove that, for any computable function $f$, it cannot be solved in time $f(k)n^{o(k / \log k)}$ where $n$ is the number of vertices of the input graph, unless the ETH fails. This lower bound almost matches the trivial $n^{O(k)}$-time algorithm. We also consider two generalizations of the Token Swapping, namely Colored Token Swapping (where the tokens have different colors and tokens of the same color are indistinguishable), and Subset Token Swapping (where each token has a set of possible destinations). To complement the hardness result, we prove that even the most general variant, Subset Token Swapping, is FPT in nowhere-dense graph classes. Finally, we consider the complexities of all three problems in very restricted classes of graphs: graphs of bounded treewidth and diameter, stars, cliques, and paths, trying to identify the borderlines between polynomial and NP-hard cases.},

We consider quantum simulation of spin systems, which could be applied to understand condensed matter phenomena. We synthesize explicit circuits for three leading quantum simulation algorithms, employing diverse techniques to tighten error bounds and optimize circuit implementations. Quantum signal processing appears to be preferred among algorithms with rigorous performance guarantees, whereas higher-order product formulas prevail if empirical error estimates suffice. Our circuits are orders of magnitude smaller than those for the simplest classically-infeasible instances of factoring and quantum chemistry.},

  abstract    = {Given a Hermitian operator $\hat{H}=\langle G|\hat{U}|G\rangle$ that is the projection of an oracle $\hat{U}$ by state $|G\rangle$ created with oracle $\hat{G}$, the problem of Hamiltonian simulation is approximating the time evolution operator $e^{-i\hat{H}t}$ at time $t$ with error $\epsilon$. We show that this can be done with query complexity $\mathcal{O}\big(t+\frac{\log{(1/\epsilon)}}{\log\log{(1/\epsilon)}}\big)$ to $\hat{G},\hat{U}$ that is optimal, not just in asymptotic limits, but for all values $t,\epsilon$. Furthermore, only $2$ additional ancilla qubits are required in total, together with $\mathcal{O}(1)$ additional single and two-qubit gates per query. Our approach to Hamiltonian simulation subsumes important prior art considering Hamiltonians which are $d$-sparse or a linear combination of unitaries, leading to significant improvements in space complexity, as well as a quadratic speed-up for precision simulations. It also motivates useful new instances, such as where $\langle G|\hat{U}|G\rangle$ is a density matrix. A key technical result is `qubitization' which uses controlled-$\hat{U}$ and controlled-$\hat{G}$ to embed $\hat{H}$ in an invariant $\text{SU}(2)$ subspace. A large class of operator functions of $\hat{H}$ can then be computed with optimal query complexity, of which $e^{-i\hat{H}t}$ is a special case.},

  abstract    = {In the past years, quantum computers more and more have evolved from an academic idea to an upcoming reality. IBM's project IBM Q can be seen as evidence of this progress. Launched in March 2017 with the goal to provide access to quantum computers for a broad audience, this allowed users to conduct quantum experiments on a 5-qubit and, since June 2017, also on a 16-qubit quantum computer (called IBM QX2 and IBM QX3, respectively). Revised versions of these 5-qubit and 16-qubit quantum computers (named IBM QX4 and IBM QX5, respectively) are available since September 2017. In order to use these, the desired quantum functionality (e.g. provided in terms of a quantum circuit) has to be properly mapped so that the underlying physical constraints are satisfied - a complex task. This demands solutions to automatically and efficiently conduct this mapping process. In this paper, we propose a methodology which addresses this problem, i.e. maps the given quantum functionality to a realization which satisfies all constraints given by the architecture and, at the same time, keeps the overhead in terms of additionally required quantum gates minimal. The proposed methodology is generic, can easily be configured for similar future architectures, and is fully integrated into IBM's SDK. Experimental evaluations show that the proposed approach clearly outperforms IBM's own mapping solution. In fact, for many quantum circuits, the proposed approach determines a mapping to the IBM architecture within minutes, while IBM's solution suffers from long runtimes and runs into a timeout of 1 hour in several cases. As an additional benefit, the proposed approach yields mapped circuits with smaller costs (i.e. fewer additional gates are required). All implementations of the proposed methodology is publicly available at http://iic.jku.at/eda/research/ibm_qx_mapping.},

In this work, we examine the impact of different graph structures on the preparation of entangled states. We begin by explaining a formal framework, the hierarchical product, in which modular graphs can be easily constructed. This framework naturally leads us to suggest a class of graphs, which we dub hierarchies. We argue that such graphs have favorable properties for quantum information processing, such as a small diameter and small total edge weight, and use the concept of Pareto efficiency to identify promising quantum graph architectures. We present numerical and analytical results on the speed at which large entangled states can be created on nearest-neighbor grids and hierarchy graphs. We also present a scheme for performing circuit placement--the translation from circuit diagrams to machine qubits--on quantum systems whose connectivity is described by hierarchies.},

This is a parallel routing model which was introduced by Alon et al\cite{alon1994routing}. The model can be viewed as a communication scheme on a distributed network. The nodes in the network can communicate via matchings (a step), where a node exchanges data (pebbles) with its matched partner. Let $G$ be a connected graph with vertices labeled from $\{1,...,n\}$ and the destination vertices of the pebbles are given by a permutation $\pi$. The problem is to find a minimum step routing scheme for the input permutation $\pi$. This is denoted as the routing time $rt(G,\pi)$ of $G$ given $\pi$. In this paper we characterize the complexity of some known problems under the routing via matching model and discuss their relationship to graph connectivity and clique number. We also introduce some new problems in this domain, which may be of independent interest.},

  abstract    = {This paper addresses the problem of finding the depth overhead that will be incurred when running quantum algorithms on near-term quantum computers. Specifically, it is envisaged that near-term quantum computers will have low qubit connectivity: each qubit will only be able to interact with a subset of the other qubits, a reality typically represented by a qubit interaction graph in which a vertex represents a qubit and an edge represents a possible direct 2-qubit interaction (gate). Thus the depth overhead is unavoidably incurred by introducing swap gates into the quantum circuit to enable general qubit interactions. This paper proves that there exist quantum circuits where a depth overhead in $\Omega(\log n)$ must necessarily be incurred when running quantum algorithms with $n$ qubits on quantum computers whose qubit interaction graph has finite degree, but that such a depth overhead is achievable.},

Several different quantum circuits implementing Shor's algorithm have been designed, but each tacitly assumes that arbitrary pairs of qubits within the computer can be interacted. While some quantum computer architectures possess this property, many promising proposals are best suited to realising a single line of qubits with nearest neighbour interactions only. In light of this, we present a circuit implementing Shor's factorisation algorithm designed for such a linear nearest neighbour architecture. Despite the interaction restrictions, the circuit requires just $2L+4$ qubits and to first order requires $8L^{4}$ gates arranged in a circuit of depth $32L^{3}$ -- identical to first order to that possible using an architecture that can interact arbitrary pairs of qubits.},

This allows minimum-depth circuits (up to a constant factor) for the nearest-neighbor architecture to be obtained from minimum-depth circuits in the standard abstract model. Our work therefore justifies the standard assumption that interactions can be performed between arbitrary pairs of qubits. In particular, our results imply that Shor's algorithm, controlled operations and fanouts can be implemented in constant depth, polynomial size and polynomial width in this architecture. We also present optimal non-adaptive quantum circuits for controlled operations and fanouts on a kD grid. These circuits have depth Theta(n^(1 / k)), size Theta(n) and width Theta(n). Our lower bound also applies to a more general class of operations.},

In this paper we improve their algorithms in sev- eral ways, getting better dependence on those other parameters. To this end we develop new techniques for quantum algorithms, for instance a general way to efficiently implement smooth functions of sparse Hamiltonians, and a generalized minimum-finding procedure.
We also show limits on this approach to quantum SDP-solvers, for instance for combinatorial optimizations problems that have a lot of symmetry. Finally, we prove some general lower bounds showing that in the worst case, the complexity of every quantum LP-solver (and hence also SDP-solver) has to scale linearly with mn when m ≈ n, which is the same as classical.},

We consider the algorithmic question of finding a shortest sequence of swaps such that token $T_i$ is on vertex $i$. We are able to achieve essentially matching upper and lower bounds, for exact algorithms and approximation algorithms. For exact algorithms, we rule out any $2^{o(n)}$ algorithm under the ETH. This is matched with a simple $2^{O(n\log n)}$ algorithm based on a breadth-first search in an auxiliary graph. We show one general $4$-approximation and show APX-hardness. Thus, there is a small constant $\delta>1$ such that every polynomial time approximation algorithm has approximation factor at least $\delta$. Our results also hold for a generalized version, where tokens and vertices are colored. In this generalized version each token must go to a vertex with the same color.},

Our modification does not require additional ancilla qubits. Then, we demonstrate how many operations can be parallelized, leading to a further linear decrease in the parallel depth of the circuit, at the cost of a small constant factor increase in number of qubits required. Thirdly, we modify the term order in the Trotter-Suzuki decomposition, significantly reducing the error at given Trotter-Suzuki timestep. A final improvement modifies the Hamiltonian to reduce errors introduced by the non-zero Trotter-Suzuki timestep.

  abstract = {Communication is a key part of society that we make huge investments in. Each message has to both arrive quickly and use minimal network resources. Moreover, communications must sometimes also remain private, so encryption is used to prevent third parties from listening in. However, standard classical encryption protocols are proven not to be secure against quantum adversaries. With quantum communication we have a method that does provably attains perfect secrecy, even against adversaries with unlimited (quantum) computational power. It is, however, infeasible to have a direct quantum connection between all users of quantum communications. We thus look into the possibilities of a quantum network, which is able to connect arbitrary users of the network as if they had direct quantum channel available.
Once such a quantum network is built, we will need to route quantum messages e ectively to their destina- tion. In this work, we take the  rst step in studying network structures for quantum networks on a high level, and their accompanying routing algorithms. Current ongoing research into quantum communication with satellites and the possibility of a global network made the case of a quantum network of satellites relevant. We will consider a simpli ed model where each satellite can perform quantum communication with its immediate neighbours, and can create quantum virtual links that form shortcuts through the network.
The  rst step towards a quantum network that we take is the structure of the network. Using virtual links as shortcuts we can reduce the maximum distance between nodes (the diameter) by an exponential factor. Let |V | be the size of the set of all vertices in a graph, equal to the number of satellites. Then for the case of satellites we give a network structure with the following properties:
()
$\bullet$ The diameter of the graph is 4 log |V |$-$2 + 3 = O(log |V |). This means that the distance between any 2 10
two nodes in the graph will scale logarithmically in the number of nodes.
()
$\bullet$ The maximum degree of a vertex is 12 log |V |$-$2 + 6 = O(log |V |). The degree of a vertex is directly 2 10
related to the size of its quantum memory. Since quantum memories are currently limited in size, it is important for feasibility reasons that the degree stays low.
With a logarithmic scaling, the diameter and degree scale well for large graphs. This is especially relevant for networks, which can become large. A lower distance between vertices also allows quantum communications to fail less often, in e ect decreasing the communication time. We can thus achieve a much smaller diameter by using virtual links, while the degree of each vertex remains low.
We furthermore give a routing algorithm for  nding the shortest path on this network structure that only uses local information at each vertex to route, where local information is the nearby surroundings of a vertex. The routing algorithm has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The space complexity of the algorithm is O(log5 |V |) per vertex. A small space complexity implies little memory usage of the algorithm. Since network routers are typically small computers, the small memory requirement allows them to run this algorithm.
$\bullet$ The time complexity of the algorithm is O(log2 |V |) per vertex. A small time complexity allows network nodes to compute the next step in the path in minimal time. The time necessary to communicate decreases with decreasing time complexity.
For large enough |V |, our algorithm outperforms standard routing algorithms such as Dijkstra{\textquoteright}s algorithm by an exponential factor. Furthermore, we have proved that the local routing algorithm always gives a shortest path. Local routing transitions well into a real world implementation, so that every network router can make simple decisions for routing.},

  abstract    = {We propose a time-independent Hamiltonian protocol for the reversal of qubit ordering in a chain of $N$ spins. Our protocol has an easily implementable nearest-neighbor, transverse-field Ising model Hamiltonian with time-independent, non-uniform couplings. Under appropriate normalization, we implement this state reversal three times faster than a naive approach using SWAP gates, in time comparable to a protocol of Raussendorf [Phys. Rev. A 72, 052301 (2005)] that requires dynamical control. We also prove lower bounds on state reversal by using results on the entanglement capacity of Hamiltonians and show that we are within a factor $1.502(1+1/N)$ of the shortest time possible. Our lower bound holds for all nearest-neighbor qubit protocols with arbitrary finite ancilla spaces and local operations and classical communication. Finally, we extend our protocol to an infinite family of nearest-neighbor, time-independent Hamiltonian protocols for state reversal. This includes chains with nearly uniform coupling that may be especially feasible for experimental implementation.},

  abstract    = {Layout synthesis, an important step in quantum computing, processes quantum circuits to satisfy device layout constraints. In this paper, we construct QUEKO benchmarks for this problem, which have known optimal depth. We use QUEKO to evaluate the optimality of current layout synthesis tools, including Cirq from Google, Qiskit from IBM, $\mathsf{t}|\mathsf{ket}\rangle$ from Cambridge Quantum Computing, and recent academic work. To our surprise, despite over a decade of research and development by academia and industry on compilation and synthesis for quantum circuits, we are still able to demonstrate large optimality gaps. Even combining the best of all four solutions we evaluated, the gap is still about 4x for circuits with depths suitable for state-of-the-art devices. This suggests substantial room for improvement. Finally, we also prove the NP-completeness of the layout synthesis problem for quantum computing. We have made the QUEKO benchmarks open source.},

We focus on a novel technique based around phase gadgets, a family of multi-qubit quantum operations which occur naturally in a wide range of quantum circuits of practical interest. The phase gadgets have a simple presentation in the ZX-calculus, which makes it easy to reason about them. Taking advantage of this, we present an efficient method to translate the phase gadgets back to CNOT gates and single qubit operations suitable for execution on a quantum computer with significant reductions in gate count and circuit depth. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods on a quantum chemistry benchmarking set based on variational circuits for ground state estimation of small molecules.},

In particular, given a quantum circuit, we construct an undirected graph with edge weights a function of the two-qubit gates of the quantum circuit. Taking inspiration from spectral graph drawing, we use an eigenvector of the graph Laplacian to place logical qubits at coordinate locations. These placements are then mapped to physical qubits for a given connectivity. We primarily focus on one-dimensional connectivities, and sketch how the general principles of our heuristic can be extended for use in more general connectivities.},

  abstract     = {Many physical implementations of quantum computers impose stringent memory constraints in which 2-qubit operations can only be performed between qubits which are nearest neighbours in a lattice or graph structure. Hence, before a computation can be run on such a device, it must be mapped onto the physical architecture. That is, logical qubits must be assigned physical locations in the quantum memory, and the circuit must be replaced by an equivalent one containing only operations between nearest neighbours. In this paper, we give a new technique for quantum circuit mapping (a.k.a. routing), based on Gaussian elimination constrained to certain optimal spanning trees called Steiner trees. We give a reference implementation of the technique for CNOT circuits and show that it significantly out-performs general-purpose routines on CNOT circuits. We then comment on how the technique can be extended straightforwardly to the synthesis of CNOT+Rz circuits and as a modification to a recently-proposed circuit simplification/extraction procedure for generic circuits based on the ZX-calculus.},

  abstract    = {The ZX-Calculus is a graphical language for diagrammatic reasoning in quantum mechanics and quantum information theory. It comes equipped with an equational presentation. We focus here on a very important property of the language: completeness, which roughly ensures the equational theory captures all of quantum mechanics. We first improve on the known-to-be-complete presentation or the so-called Clifford fragment of the language - a restriction that is not universal - by adding some axioms. Thanks to a system of back-and-forth translation between the ZX-Calculus and a third-party complete graphical language, we prove that the provided axiomatisation is complete for the first approximately universal fragment of the language, namely Clifford+T. We then prove that the expressive power of this presentation, though aimed at achieving completeness for the aforementioned restriction, extends beyond Clifford+T, to a class of diagrams that we call linear with Clifford+T constants. We use another version of the third-party language - and an adapted system of back-and-forth translation - to complete the language for the ZX-Calculus as a whole, that is, with no restriction. We briefly discuss the added axioms, and finally, we provide a complete axiomatisation for an altered version of the language which involves an additional generator, making the presentation simpler.},

We first interpret quantum circuits as ZX-diagrams, which provide a flexible, lower-level language for describing quantum computations graphically. Then, using the rules of the ZX-calculus, we give a simplification strategy for ZX-diagrams based on the two graph transformations of local complementation and pivoting and show that the resulting reduced diagram can be transformed back into a quantum circuit. While little is known about extracting circuits from arbitrary ZX-diagrams, we show that the underlying graph of our simplified ZX-diagram always has a graph-theoretic property called generalised flow, which in turn yields a deterministic circuit extraction procedure. By breaking the rigid circuit structure, this technique enables us to `see around' gates that obstruct standard optimisation techniques based on stabilisers or phase-polynomials, allowing us to find new reductions.},

  abstract    = {Quantum circuits are the preferred formalism for expressing quantum information processing tasks. Quantum circuit design automation methods mostly use a waterfall approach and consider that high level circuit descriptions are hardware agnostic. This assumption has lead to a static circuit perspective: the number of quantum bits and quantum gates is determined before circuit execution and everything is considered reliable with zero probability of failure. Many different schemes for achieving reliable fault-tolerant quantum computation exist, with different schemes suitable for different architectures. A number of large experimental groups are developing architectures well suited to being protected by surface quantum error correcting codes. Such circuits could include unreliable logical elements, such as state distillation, whose failure can be determined only after their actual execution. Therefore, practical logical circuits, as envisaged by many groups, are likely to have a dynamic structure. This requires an online scheduling of their execution: one knows for sure what needs to be executed only after previous elements have finished executing. This work shows that scheduling shares similarities with place and route methods. The work also introduces the first online schedulers of quantum circuits protected by surface codes. The work also highlights scheduling efficiency by comparing the new methods with state of the art static scheduling of surface code protected fault-tolerant circuits.},

  abstract    = {The cost of enabling connectivity in Noisy-Intermediate-Scale-Quantum devices is an important factor in determining computational power. We have created a qubit routing algorithm which enables efficient global connectivity in a particular trapped ion quantum computing architecture. The routing algorithm was characterized by comparison against both a strict lower bound, and a positional swap based routing algorithm. We propose an error model which can be used to estimate the achievable circuit depth and quantum volume of the device as a function of experimental parameters. We use a new metric based on quantum volume, but with native two qubit gates, to assess the cost of connectivity relative to the upper bound of free, all to all connectivity. The metric was also used to assess a square grid superconducting device. We compare these two architectures and find that for the shuttling parameters used, the trapped ion design has a substantially lower cost associated with connectivity.},

Since NISQ computers constraint two-qubit operations on limited couplings, an input circuit must be transformed into an equivalent output circuit obeying the constraints. The transformation often requires additional gates that can affect the accuracy of running the circuit. Based upon a previous work of quantum circuit mapping that leverages gate commutation rules, this paper shows algorithms that utilize both transformation and commutation rules. Experiments on a standard benchmark dataset confirm the algorithms with more rules can find even better circuit mappings compared with the previously-known best algorithms.},

  abstract    = {In this work, we make a connection between two seemingly different problems. The first problem involves characterizing the properties of entanglement in the ground state of gapped local Hamiltonians, which is a central topic in quantum many-body physics. The second problem is on the quantum communication complexity of testing bipartite states with EPR assistance, a well-known question in quantum information theory. We construct a communication protocol for testing (or measuring) the ground state and use its communication complexity to reveal a new structural property for the ground state entanglement. This property, known as the entanglement spread, roughly measures the ratio between the largest and the smallest Schmidt coefficients across a cut in the ground state. Our main result shows that gapped ground states possess limited entanglement spread across any cut, exhibiting an "area law" behavior. Our result quite generally applies to any interaction graph with an improved bound for the special case of lattices. This entanglement spread area law includes interaction graphs constructed in [Aharonov et al., FOCS'14] that violate a generalized area law for the entanglement entropy. Our construction also provides evidence for a conjecture in physics by Li and Haldane on the entanglement spectrum of lattice Hamiltonians [Li and Haldane, PRL'08]. On the technical side, we use recent advances in Hamiltonian simulation algorithms along with quantum phase estimation to give a new construction for an approximate ground space projector (AGSP) over arbitrary interaction graphs.},

  abstract    = {In quantum many-body systems with local interactions, quantum information and entanglement cannot spread outside of a linear light cone, which expands at an emergent velocity analogous to the speed of light. Local operations at sufficiently separated spacetime points approximately commute -given a many-body state, $\mathcal{O}_x(t) \mathcal{O}_y |\psi\rangle \approx \mathcal{O}_y\mathcal{O}_x(t) |\psi\rangle$ with arbitrarily small errors -- so long as $|x-y|\gtrsim vt$, where $v$ is finite. Yet most non-relativistic physical systems realized in nature have long-range interactions: two degrees of freedom separated by a distance $r$ interact with potential energy $V(r) \propto 1/r^{\alpha}$. In systems with long-range interactions, we rigorously establish a hierarchy of linear light cones: at the same $\alpha$, some quantum information processing tasks are constrained by a linear light cone while others are not. In one spatial dimension, this linear light cone exists for every many-body state when $\alpha>3$ (Lieb-Robinson light cone); for a typical state chosen uniformly at random from the Hilbert space when $\alpha>\frac{5}{2}$ (Frobenius light cone); for every state of a non-interacting system when $\alpha>2$ (free light cone). These bounds apply to time-dependent systems and are optimal up to subalgebraic improvements. Our theorems regarding the Lieb-Robinson and free light cones -- and their tightness -- also generalize to arbitrary dimensions. We discuss the implications of our bounds on the growth of connected correlators and of topological order, the clustering of correlations in gapped systems, and the digital simulation of systems with long-range interactions. In addition, we show that universal quantum state transfer, as well as many-body quantum chaos, are bounded by the Frobenius light cone, and therefore are poorly constrained by all Lieb-Robinson bounds.},

We prove that the commutator norm $\lVert [A(t),B]\rVert$ is upper bounded by a topological combinatorial problem: counting irreducible weighted paths between two points on the Hamiltonian's factor graph. We show that the Lieb-Robinson velocity always overestimates the ballistic growth of operators. In quantum systems drawn from zero-mean random ensembles with few-body interactions, we prove stronger bounds on the ensemble-averaged $\mathbb{E}\left[ \lVert [A(t),B]\rVert^2\right]$. In such quantum systems on Erd\"os-R\'enyi factor graphs, we prove that the scrambling time $t_{\mathrm{s}}$, at which $\lVert [A(t_{\mathrm{s}}),B]\rVert=\mathrm{\Theta}(1)$, is almost surely $t_{\mathrm{s}}=\mathrm{\Omega}(\sqrt{\log N})$; we further prove $t_{\mathrm{s}}=\mathrm{\Omega}(\log N) $ to high order in perturbation theory in $1/N$. We constrain infinite temperature quantum chaos in the $q$-local Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model at any order in $1/N$; at leading order, our upper bound on the Lyapunov exponent is within a factor of 2 of the known result at any $q>2$.

At the same time, they can be described by a number of parameters that grows only moderately with the system size. They have a variety of applications in quantum information theory, most prominently as algorithmic resources in the context of the one-way quantum computer, but also in other fields such as quantum error correction and multi-partite quantum communication, as well as in the study of foundational issues such as non-locality and decoherence. In this review, we give a tutorial introduction into the theory of graph states. We introduce various equivalent ways how to define graph states, and discuss the basic notions and properties of these states. The focus of this review is on their entanglement properties. These include aspects of non-locality, bi-partite and multi-partite entanglement and its classification in terms of the Schmidt measure, the distillability properties of mixed entangled states close to a pure graph state, as well as the robustness of their entanglement under decoherence.

This allows for two-qubit operations to be performed between qubits which are remote from each other in $G$, through gate teleportation. We demonstrate how adapting \emph{quantum linear network coding} to this problem of entanglement distribution in a network of qubits can be used to solve the problem of distributing Bell states and GHZ states in parallel, when bottlenecks in $G$ would otherwise force such entangled states to be distributed sequentially. In particular, we show that by reduction to classical network coding protocols for the $k$-pairs problem or multiple multicast problem in a fixed network $G$, one can distribute entanglement between the transmitters and receivers with a Clifford circuit whose quantum depth is some (typically small and easily computed) constant, which does not depend on the size of $G$, however remote the transmitters and receivers are, or the number of transmitters and receivers. These results also generalise straightforwardly to qudits of any prime dimension. We demonstrate our results using a specialised formalism, distinct from and more efficient than the stabiliser formalism, which is likely to be helpful to reason about and prototype such quantum linear network coding circuits.},

  abstract    = {Recent years have witnessed the fast development of quantum computing. Researchers around the world are eager to run larger and larger quantum algorithms that promise speedups impossible to any classical algorithm. However, the available quantum computers are still volatile and error-prone. Thus, layout synthesis, which transforms quantum programs to meet these hardware limitations, is a crucial step in the realization of quantum computing. In this paper, we present two synthesizers, one optimal and one approximate but nearly optimal. Although a few optimal approaches to this problem have been published, our optimal synthesizer explores a larger solution space, thus is optimal in a stronger sense. In addition, it reduces time and space complexity exponentially compared to some leading optimal approaches. The key to this success is a more efficient spacetime-based variable encoding of the layout synthesis problem as a mathematical programming problem. By slightly changing our formulation, we arrive at an approximate synthesizer that is even more efficient and outperforms some leading heuristic approaches, in terms of additional gate cost, by up to 100%, and also fidelity by up to 10x on a comprehensive set of benchmark programs and architectures. For a specific family of quantum programs named QAOA, which is deemed to be a promising application for near-term quantum computers, we further adjust the approximate synthesizer by taking commutation into consideration, achieving up to 75% reduction in depth and up to 65% reduction in additional cost compared to the tool used in a leading QAOA study.},

  abstract     = {We present methods for implementing arbitrary permutations of qubits under interaction constraints. Our protocols make use of previous methods for rapidly reversing the order of qubits along a path. Given nearest-neighbor interactions on a path of length $n$, we show that there exists a constant $\epsilon \approx 0.034$ such that the quantum routing time is at most $(1-\epsilon)n$, whereas any swap-based protocol needs at least time $n-1$. This represents the first known quantum advantage over swap-based routing methods and also gives improved quantum routing times for realistic architectures such as grids. Furthermore, we show that our algorithm approaches a quantum routing time of $2n/3$ in expectation for uniformly random permutations, whereas swap-based protocols require time $n$ asymptotically. Additionally, we consider sparse permutations that route $k \le n$ qubits and give algorithms with quantum routing time at most $n/3 + O(k^2)$ on paths and at most $2r/3 + O(k^2)$ on general graphs with radius $r$.},

  abstract    = {The discovery of quantum error correction has greatly improved the long-term prospects for quantum computing technology. Encoded quantum information can be protected from errors that arise due to uncontrolled interactions with the environment, or due to imperfect implementations of quantum logical operations. Recovery from errors can work effectively even if occasional mistakes occur during the recovery procedure. Furthermore, encoded quantum information can be processed without serious propagation of errors. In principle, an arbitrarily long quantum computation can be performed reliably, provided that the average probability of error per gate is less than a certain critical value, the accuracy threshold. It may be possible to incorporate intrinsic fault tolerance into the design of quantum computing hardware, perhaps by invoking topological Aharonov-Bohm interactions to process quantum information.},
